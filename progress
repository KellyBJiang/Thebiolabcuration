    1.iframe Issue:
        - iframe doesn't have content:
            This line works by using https instead of http:
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://ryanleetcode.blogspot.com/2015/07/backtracking.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
        - when trying to get the content from the iframe and highlight it:
            ERROR:
                Uncaught DOMException: Failed to read the 'contentDocument' property from 'HTMLIFrameElement': 
                Blocked a frame with origin "https://curation-website-mitiao.c9users.io" from accessing a cross-origin frame.

            SOLUTION: unsolved

    1.add css and  js file in  in django:
        - add the files in the static folder in the app.
        - drag the files in.
        - Add the following to the html head.
            <!--CSS in static for assign page-->
	        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'administrator/css/style.css' %}" />
	        <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'administrator/multiselect.js' %}"></script>
    2. add mysql in django:
        Cars.objects.raw('SELECT max(id), SubStr(brand,1,1) AS letter, brand FROM myapp_cars GROUP BY substr(brand,1,1)')
        
#08/11/2017
    1. Add "POST" from html to django view:
        - add ajax in javascript function:
            $.ajax({
                 type:"POST",
                 url:"/ad/assign/",                                         // same with the url in 'urls.py'
                 data: {
                      'selected_datasets[]': selected_datasets,              //the array to be post
                      'selected_topic':selected_topic,                       //the variable to be post
                      csrfmiddlewaretoken: "{{ csrf_token }}",               //to avoid Error:POST 403 forbidden
                 },
        -in views.py, add the following to get the array value, this works for both a single value and an array.
            selected_datasets=request.POST.getlist('selected_datasets[]') 
            selected_topic = request.POST.get('selected_topic')
            
            print selected_datasets
            print selected_topic
